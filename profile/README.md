## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Who I'm? - I'm de1v making Anti-Bot and Anti-DDoS protection for Minecraft servers.
Yea, another copy of TCP Shield, But in Czechia with the best protection you can get!

Why Dearths is created? - I'm interested in protections about Layer 4 and 7, and want to make some products!

Is there anything you already made? - Yea and no, It is called GayShield.pro, It is almost complete and will be running in few weeks!

How much will cost GayShield.pro? - It won't be expensive, but Hosting and because I'm solo developer student, It won't be the cheapest too.

Who made this shitty README? - Me (de1v), I know its bad, I'm doing this in school.
